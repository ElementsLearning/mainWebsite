  "title": "The story of dinosaur extinction",
  "summary": "In 1956, Joseph Shklovsky theorized that a supernova caused the dinosaurs' extinction. In the 1970s, Walter Alvarez discovered a thin layer of clay, known as the KT boundary, which marked a mass extinction event. With help from his father Luis Alvarez and chemist Frank Asaro, they found high levels of iridium in the clay, suggesting a global impact event. Initially ridiculed, their asteroid impact theory gained credibility after Alan Hildebrand identified the Chicxulub crater in Mexico in 1990. The 1994 impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter demonstrated the potential for such catastrophic events, supporting the Alvarez hypothesis. This summary is based on information from various sources, notably Bill Bryson.",

This is a point known to geology as the KT boundary and it marks the time, sixty-five million years ago, when the dinosaurs and roughly half the world's other species of animals abruptly vanished from the fossil record. K comes either from the Greek Kreta or German Kreide. Both conveniently mean “chalk,” which is also what Cretaceous means\nAlvarez wondered what it was about a thin lamina of clay, barely a quarter of an inch thick, that could account for such a dramatic moment in Earth's history.\nBut the thinness of the clay layer clearly suggested that in Umbria, if nowhere else, something rather more abrupt had happened. Unfortunately in the 1970s no tests existed for determining how long such a deposit might have taken to accumulate.\n",
